### Binary image classification model using VGG-16
This code implements a binary image classification model using the pre-trained VGG-16 architecture. The model is fine-tuned for a specific binary classification task, such as distinguishing between two classes of images (e.g., true vs. false or class A vs. class B).

### The code is described below:

1. Importing the libraries: 
This imports the necessary libraries for building, training, and testing the CNN.

2. Loading the Pre-trained VGG-16 Model:
This loads the VGG-16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, excluding the top fully connected layers, and sets the input shape to (224, 224, 3).

3. Freezing VGG-16 Layers:
This freezes the layers of the VGG-16 base model so that their weights are not updated during training.

4. Adding Custom Classification Layers:
This adds a flatten layer to convert the 2D feature maps to a 1D feature vector, followed by a dense layer with 256 units and ReLU activation. The final output layer has 1 unit with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

5. Creating and Compiling the Model:
This creates the model by combining the VGG-16 base with the custom layers and compiles it using binary cross-entropy loss, the Adam optimizer, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

6. Data Preparation:
Training and testing data are prepared using "ImageDataGenerator" to rescale pixel values to the range [0,1].

7. Training and evaluating the model:
The model is trained on the training data for 5 epochs and validation is done on the test data after each epoch.

8. Testing Individual Images:
A loop reads 10 images and each one is tested using the custom do_test method.
